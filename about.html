            <h2 class="ui header">Meet Maria</h2>
            
            <p>Maria is a working mom of three. She is always on the go.
                Maria is constantly juggling many responsibilities including work, family, and self care. Sometimes it
                can lead a
                busy mom to burn herself out!</p>
            <p>We created "Foodie" For a mother like Maria who can't find the time in her busy schedule. In the world of
                a
                mom there are many things you have to handle.</p>
            <p>Why not not let "Foodie" plan your meals for you!</p>
            <p>"Foodie" gives you menu options throughout the week so you don't have to come up with the ideas for
                dinner
                tonight. Plus, we'll create a grocery list that you can access right from your phone.
                All you have to to do is select, prepare, cook, and serve, giving you more time to do the things that
                matter most to you.
